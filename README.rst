NewRelic Synthetics (unofficial) CLI (NeReS)
============================================

|image0| |image1| |image2|

NeReS is a cli tool to manage `NewRelic Synthetics
<https://synthetics.newrelic.com/>`__ monitors with a Synthetics Lite account
(Pro should work too). The tool emulates the actions of a user in the browser
and doesn't use the Synthetics API since that's only available to the Pro
accounts.

Use the tools you can:

-  List all your monitors, including their success rate, locations,
   notifications etc.
-  Create, update and delete monitors
-  List available locations for monitor installation

Everything you can do using the Web console is supported and provided to your
shell prompt.
